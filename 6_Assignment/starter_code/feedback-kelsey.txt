Use floats or inline-block in your CSS to achieve a two-column layout

Use the correct Open Sans Google Font typeface to style the text denoted in the design file and according to the JPEG provided
  -Good!

Use proper filename conventions (lowercase, .html)
  -Good!

Use an external CSS stylesheet to style your page
  -Good!

Add a hover effect to all the links using pseudo-classes
  -You may not have noticed this in the instructions. Hover effects are really easy.
a:hover {
  color: red;
}

Integrate drop caps using pseudo-classes
  -This is talking about those giant letters at the beginning of each post. You can target those letters with the pseudo class ::first-letter (just like you did with .blogpost:last-child). Then you just give it its own style:

.blogpost p::first-letter {
  font-size: 72px;
  float: left;
  padding-right: 10px;
  font-weight: 600;
}


Additional Comments:

Kelsey, this looks really good! Great use of comments to help organize your code.

One little thing: in your CSS file, from line 234 to the bottom, it's fine to have that in there, but it should be commented out, like:  /* blah blah blah */
The browser is just sort of ignoring it, but it's better to comment it out/not have it as live code.

Overall, this looks great! You are definitely getting the hang of this.
