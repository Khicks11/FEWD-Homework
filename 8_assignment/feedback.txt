Prevent a link execution with the event.preventDefault() function
 - Good!
Use the $.ready() handler to delay your code from executing until all DOM assets have been loaded
 - Good, but you should put all over your javascript code inside the .ready() function. Your <a> event handler is outside.
Select the appropriate DOM elements with CSS selectors upon a user's click using the $.on("click") handler
 - Good!
If a user clicks "Read More" on the primary column:

have the text in the <p> tag slide down along with a "Read Less" link in the blog post using $.slideDown() and $.show()
 - Good!
hide the "Read More" link using $.hide()
 - Good!
If a user clicks "Read Less" on the primary column:

have the <p> slide up and hide the "Read Less" link using $.slideUp() and $.hide()
 - Good!
show the "Read More" link using $.show()
 - Good!
Using the same functions as above, if a user clicks the "Learn More" link in the sidebar, have the <span> inside that <p> slide down and hide the "Learn More" link using $.slideDown() and $.hide()
 - Good!

Additional Comments:

- Good job! all the functionality is there, your code logic is properly nested in event handlers, and all javascript statements end with a semicolon.

- Just like HTML, it's useful to keep your javascript code properly indented. Code inside an event handler function or conditional block should all be indented the same amount. This will help keep it clear about what code belongs to what event handler, conditional block, etc.
