Additional Comments:

- Great job! Good use of spacing and nice attention to detail. Nice use of descriptive class and ID names. HTML and CSS is consistent and well formatted.

- The only stylistic issue I see is that the header image is cutoff. This can be fixed by manually setting the height of your toppage class to a larger value.
